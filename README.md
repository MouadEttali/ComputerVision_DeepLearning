# ComputerVision_DeepLearning

This repository will be used to post my personal Deep learning projects as well as computer vision problems, starting off with simple image processing notebooks and hopefully delving later on with more technical and challenging problems

## 1 License plate detection :

An introductory project to familiarize with computer vision and deep learning as well, using YOLO and darket to detect and ocr the license plates.
