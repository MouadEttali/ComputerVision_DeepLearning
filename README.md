# ComputerVision_DeepLearning

This repository will be used to post my personal Deep learning projects as well as computer vision problems, starting off with simple image processing notebooks and hopefully delving later on with more technical and challenging problems

## 1 License plate detection:

An introductory project to familiarize with computer vision and deep learning as well, using YOLO and darknet to detect and Tesseract to ocr Arabic car license plates.


## 2 Pseudo Labeling with Deep neural networks: 
semi-supervised learning for deep neural networks. Basically, the proposed network is trained in a supervised fashion with labeled
and unlabeled data simultaneously. For unlabeled data, Pseudo-Labels, just picking up the class which has the maximum predicted probability, 
are used as if they were true labels
